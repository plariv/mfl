Problem

In some English words, there is a letter that appears more than once. Search through a sample of text to find the word with a letter that is repeated more times than any other letter is repeated in any other word. When there is a tie between two words, choose the word that appeared first in the sample.

The text sample will contain only alphabetic characters (“a” through “z” and “A” through “Z”), whitespace, and punctuation marks. The words will be separated by whitespace. A letter is considered to be the same letter regardless of whether it appears in uppercase or lowercase. Any punctuation marks should be ignored—so, in particular, contractions, possessives, and hyphenated words count as a single word.

Each sample is stored in a text file: Write a function that accepts a file path as its argument, and returns the chosen word as its output.

Example:

Input: “O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?”
Output: “wherefore”

Explanation: The letter “e” is repeated three times in the word “wherefore”—and this is more than any other letter is repeated in any other word!

Example:

Input: “Some people feel the rain, while others just get wet.”
Output: “people”

Explanation: Both “people” and “feel” have a letter that is repeated twice within the word. This is a tie—and the first word wins!
